# n20-racebook

## Story Time

Like the beginning of every good recipe is some BS story about what it means to the author. I'm just tired of tools for racing being prohibitively expensive. I'm also tired of my hodge-podge of excel setup sheets that nobody understands (looking at you, crew chief Mom).

My hope is that this project can assist me in making and remembering setup changes. It should be a better method than endless paper notebooks that loosely connect to one another.

## Goal

The primary objective of this web app is to learn about React JS, Firebase (or some alternative), all while developing a useful tool to aid others.

## Dependencies

- React JS
- Supabase
- More details will follow
